<h1>Style</h1>

<p>All the controls in XWT are support the feature "Style". By using
styles, you can define a common appearance such as fonts, colors and
images to a control.</p>

<!--  
<p>Style define the pieces that mark up a control respectively. All
the control in XWT are support this feature. By using styles, you can
modify the default values of properties that are set on the control to
which the style is applied. For example, you can select a style object
where you can define a common appearance such as fonts, colors and
images.</p>
-->

<p>These style properties can be overridden by the values that are
set on the control itself. For example, if you set the background color
to red in the style of a Label, the Label will appear red when it is
drawn on the live display area.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it is possible to define a style for a specific type.
It is applied to all UI elements of this type under the UI tree
structure. For example, MyUserControl component is a Label with text
"Hello, world". We can embed it into MyUserControl_default_x_Customized
component with a style.</p>
